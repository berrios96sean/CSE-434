Quiz 1 will be in class on Tuesday Jan 24th. 

review prior to class 

packet delay: Four sources 
- transmission 
- nodal processing 
- queuing 
- propogation 

d_nodal = d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop 

    NOTE: Make sure to always convert bytes -> bits, KM -> Meters 
        always ensure units match before doing any calculations. 

d = length of physical link 
s = prop speed 
d_prop = d/s 
d_trans = L/R 

// Throughput 
    - rate bits/time unit at which bits are being sent from sender to receiver 
    * instantaneous: rate at given point in time 
    * average: rate over longer period of time 

** Visual Representation on introduction 1-56 ppt 

//queueing delay, loss 
 ppt introduction 1-28 
 - if arrivale rate (bps) to link exceeds transmission rate (bps) of link for a period ot time 
    * packets will queue waiting to be transmitted on output link 
    * packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) in router fills up

// alternative to packet switching is circuit switching 
 end to end resources allocated to reserved for 'call' between source and destination 
 ** Visual representation in ppt introduction 1-30

// internet (tcp/ip) protocol stack 
 *** Sorted here from top to bottom ***
 - application: supporting network applications -- imap,smtp,http
 - transport: process-process data transfer -- tcp,udp
 - network: routing of datagrams form source to destination -- ip,routing protocols 
 - link: data transfer between neighboring network elements -- ethernet, 802.11 (wi-fi), ppp 
 - physical: bits 'on the wire'
