review prior to class 

packet delay: Four sources 
- transmission 
- nodal processing 
- queuing 
- propogation 

d_nodal = d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop 

    NOTE: Make sure to always convert bytes -> bits, KM -> Meters 
        always ensure units match before doing any calculations. 

d_prop = d/s 
d_trans = L/R
