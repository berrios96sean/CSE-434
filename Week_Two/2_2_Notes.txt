Quiz 1 will be in class on Tuesday Jan 24th. 

review prior to class 

packet delay: Four sources 
- transmission 
- nodal processing 
- queuing 
- propogation 

d_nodal = d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop 

    NOTE: Make sure to always convert bytes -> bits, KM -> Meters 
        always ensure units match before doing any calculations. 

d = length of physical link 
s = prop speed 
d_prop = d/s 
d_trans = L/R 

// Throughput 
    - rate bits/time unit at which bits are being sent from sender to receiver 
    * instantaneous: rate at given point in time 
    * average: rate over longer period of time
