// Network Mask 
    Network mask defines what the predefined specifications for the Network Address and the host Address
    for example ffff0000 defines the first 16 bits as the Network address

    CIDR notation is a shortform notation to define a network mask 
        ex. 128.143.137.144/16 

// Host Address 
    all zeros are not a valid host number -> IP address 
    all ones are not a valid host number -> Broadcast address

// Test/Exp addresses 
    will use these in the cloud lab 

// Subnetting 
    IP addresses us a 3 layer heirarchy 
        - Network
        - Subnet 
        - Host 
    Routers and Host use an extended network prefix -> this is what identifies the host #'s 

// CIDR Classless interdomain routing 
    Uses a slash '/' notation to define the net prefix 

// No Subnetting
    Diagrams in the powerpoint give a good representation of what no Subnetting looks like  

// Lab 
    BYENG ping IP address
    CloudLab design subnet to allow a certain number of hosts
