// Network Mask 
    Network mask defines what the predefined specifications for the Network Address and the host Address
    for example ffff0000 defines the first 16 bits as the Network address

    CIDR notation is a shortform notation to define a network mask 
        ex. 128.143.137.144/16 

// Host Address 
    all zeros are not a valid host number -> IP address 
    all ones are not a valid host number -> Broadcast address

// Test/Exp addresses 
    will use these in the cloud lab 

// Subnetting
