The internet is composed of networks that interconnects billions of computing devices. 
There can be a variety of devices that can act as endpoints, most notably Linux devices 
are what the majority of endpoints are using. 

End systems are connected via communication links and packet switches. 
Different links transmit data at different speeds -- transmission rate. measure in bits/sec 

When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system
segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages
of information, known as packets in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent
through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into
the original data.

A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication
links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. Packet
switches come in many shapes and flavors, but the two most prominent types in
today’s Internet are routers and link-layer switches. 

The sequence
of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a route or path through
the network

End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that
control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. The Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) are two of the most important protocols in the Internet. 

End systems attached to the Internet provide a socket interface that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to
deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system.

Edges are end systems or hosts, which can also be thought of as clients and servers 

Home access network:

    Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are
    digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable.

    each customer’s DSL modem uses the existing
    telephone line exchange data with a digital subscriber line access multiplexer
    (DSLAM) located in the telco’s local central office (CO).

    The residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone signals
    simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies:
    • A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
    • A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
    • An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band

While DSL makes use of the telco’s existing local telephone infrastructure,
cable Internet access makes use of the cable television company’s existing cable
television infrastructure.
