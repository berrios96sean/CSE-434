The internet is composed of networks that interconnects billions of computing devices. 
There can be a variety of devices that can act as endpoints, most notably Linux devices 
are what the majority of endpoints are using. 

End systems are connected via communication links and packet switches. 
Different links transmit data at different speeds -- transmission rate. measure in bits/sec 

When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system
segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages
of information, known as packets in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent
through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into
the original data.
