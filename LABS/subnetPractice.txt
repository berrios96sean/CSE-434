Your challenge is to design subnets for three LANs, with the following design constraints:

The available IP address space is the range 10.1.105.0-10.1.105.255.
LAN A must be able to support at least 41 hosts.
LAN B must be able to support at least 88 hosts.
LAN C must be able to support at least 19 hosts.


10.1.105.0-10.1.105.255

10.1.105.0 - 10.1.105.127 -- 7

10.1.105.128 - 10.1.105.191 -- 6

// Solution was correct however I put the solutions in the incorrect place
   need to ensure that the bits line up in the submission box

Consider the following network of hosts (orange) and routers (green). Your challenge is to design subnets for three LANs, with the following design constraints:

The available IP address space is the range 10.1.49.0-10.1.49.127.
LAN A must be able to support at least 21 hosts.
LAN B must be able to support at least 9 hosts.
LAN C must be able to support at least 56 hosts.

One thing to take note of is that i need to take into consideration that 
when designing the subnets only make the mask as big as necessary which for 
9 hosts i only need 4 zeros at the end of the mask.
